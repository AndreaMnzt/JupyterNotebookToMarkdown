# JupyterNotebookToMarkdown
Convert Jupyter Notebooks to Markdown, copying attached images in a folder. 

# Why
Nbconvert does not correctly copy images attached to a notebook cell (with ctrl-v). \
This simple script saves the attached images in a folder and attaches them in the markdown file.

# Usage
```
chmod +x notebook2markdown.py 
./notebook2markdown.py filename.ipynb
```
